The command to initialize the server :
1. npm i
2. echo 'any number' > port //p.s. any number had better greater than 8000 to be a safer port
3. npm start


=============================================================================================

connect from browser tutorial 
for example if your port is 8451  
and you want to visit aboutus/index.html
following is your url (this must do after you set up server )
luffy.ee.ncku.edu.tw:8451 is in public dir so this url is like

luffy.ee.ncku.edu.tw:8451/aboutus/index.html
